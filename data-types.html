    // The JavaScript is a "dynamically typed" language, we not have to specify the data types at variable declaration unlike C/C++ or Java. Variables can store any data type in it.
    // There are total 8 data types in JavaScript. These are as follows-

    // 1.Number
    // 2.String
    // 3.BigInt
    // 4.Boolean
    // 5.Null
    // 6.Undefined
    // 7.Object
    // 8.Symbol

    //// 1.Number//////

    //     Numbers as the name suggest, it used to store numbers. Numbers can be integers, fractions, or Infinity/-Infinity and NaN(Not a Number).

    // Example-
    let int = 123; // integer
    let fraction = 1.2; // fraction
    let infinity = Infinity; // Infinity

    ///////// String/////////
    // String is the type of data in which, there is a bunch of alphanumeric characters and other symbols are together. In other words, it is a group of characters. Strings are to be surrounded by quotes, single or double.

    // Example-
    let str = "abc123,./";
    // string can have alphanumeric and other symbols
    alert(
      `The back-tics can used to use variables in in between the string like str is- ${str}!`
    );
    // The back-tics can used to use variables in in between the string like str is- abc123,./

    ///////// BigInt /////////
    //     BigInt is made to accommodate really large numbers which are more than 2^53 -1 or less -(2^53 -1) due to its technical limitations. They are represented by appending 'n' after the number.

    // Example-
    let bigint = 123456789123456789123456789n;

    ///////// Boolean ////////////////////
    // Boolean is used to represent true or false values. Sometimes we only two values for our function or we have to check some condition that is true or false.
    // Boolean values can also come as a result of comparision.

    // Example-
    let isTrueOrFalse = true;
    let firstIsGreaterOrNot = 7 > 9;
    console.log(firstIsGreaterOrNot); // false

    /////////////////////////// Null //////////////////////////
    // People often confused between null value and undefined value(non existing value). Null values represents "nothing", "empty" or "unknown".

    // Example-

    let value = null;
console.log(value); // null
